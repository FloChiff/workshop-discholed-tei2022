# From a collection of documents to a published edition: how to use an end-to-end publication pipeline

## Presentation of the workshop
The goal of our workshop is to demonstrate how a digital literary corpus could be processed for publication with TEI Publisher.

The workshop participants will learn to experiment with a ready-to-use solution that provides an easy and quick publication of a corpus. They will also get tips and shortcuts to help speed up the creation of a digital edition.

By the end of the session, this workshop will provide the participants with a visualization of their respective corpus, with side by side transformed text and original image; all of which then showing what can be achieved while working with TEI in the context of an end-to-end publication pipeline.  

The program for this workshop is the following: 

* firstly, it will start with a presentation of the pipeline, its objectives and how it works.
* Then, the time we have will be divided into several slots corresponding to every step of the pipeline. Each slot will start with a quick presentation of what is expected of the participants and what tools they will need to use.
* Next, they will be allotted some time to work with their data and to process them for publication.
* At the end of the day, a 30mn feedback session will make it possible for each participant as well as for the workshop organizers to assess the benefits of the session and envision further possible collaborations.
