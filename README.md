# From a collection of documents to a published edition : how to use an end-to-end publication pipeline

## Presentation of the workshop
The goal of our workshop is to demonstrate how a corpus could be processed for publication with TEI Publisher. The workshop participants will learn to experiment with a ready-to-use solution that provides an easy and quick publication of a corpus. They will also get tips and shortcuts to help speed up the creation of a digital edition. Moreover, by the end of the session, this workshop will provide the participants with a visualization of their respective corpus, with side by side transformed text and original image; all of which then showing what can be achieved while working with TEI in the context of an end-to-end publication pipeline.  
The program for this workshop is the following: firstly, it will start with a presentation of the pipeline, its objectives and how it works. Then, the time we have will be divided into several slots corresponding to every step of the pipeline. Each slot will start with a quick presentation of what is expected of the participants and what tools they will need to use. Next, they will be allotted some time to work with their data and to process them for publication. At the end of the day, a 30mn feedback session will make it possible for each participant as well as for the workshop organizers to assess the benefits of the session and envision further possible collaborations.
